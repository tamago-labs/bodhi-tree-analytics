## Cloud Web3 Agent

Today, many blockchain foundations and major projects in the ecosystem provide SDKs for building AI agents that enable interaction with DeFi protocols and other blockchain applications through natural language. Some well-known SDKs include **MetaMove’s Move Agent Kit**, **Crypto.com’s AI Agent Kit** and **SendAI’s Solana Agent Kit**.

**Cloud Web3 Agent** provides a solution for deploying and managing these Web3 AI agents with ease. It provides a managed infrastructure built on AWS serverless architecture, packaged in an open-source AWS Amplify stack. This ensures low operational costs, high flexibility and seamless AI agent deployment.

## Features

- **Instant Deployment:** Deploy a new agent by selecting the blockchain and SDK to use and have a ready-to-use AI agent within seconds.
- **Chat Interface:** Start chatting to swap, stake, lend or perform any actions supported by the SDK. Tasks can also be scheduled to run periodically, such as monitoring healthy collateral ratios.
- **Marketplace System:** Enables fine-tuned AI agents to be monetized on the marketplace.
- **Multiple SDK Support:** Currently supports MetaMove Move Agent Kit, with Solana and Cronos support coming soon.

The project is under heavy development, with analytics data currently mocked and payments not yet functional.
